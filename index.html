        The beginnings — Michael Learns to Rock (1988–1992)
        In 1988, singer Jascha Richter with the intent of forming a band to perform his songs, asked his high school
        friend and drummer Kåre Wanscher in Aarhus, Denmark to perform with him. Realizing the limitations of playing as
        a duo, they recruited the guitarist Mikkel Lentz, who was then playing rock music with his group the Rocking
        Studs. On 15 March 1988, their first night of practice made them realize they needed a fourth musician, so they
        asked Søren Madsen, another guitarist who was into Led Zeppelin, to join in on bass guitar.[1] Although Madsen
        was not an obvious choice for a pop band, he was invited on the basis that he had been part of the band Hip Hop
        that had reached the finals of a Danish competition to nominate a song to the Eurovision Song Contest.

        Since Richter already had a number of original songs, eliminating the need to jam, they were able to quickly
        record a demo tape intending it to be sent to the 'Rock Grand Prix' competition in their hometown Aarhus, they
        had to hurriedly come up with a name before posting it; Richter wrote as the name of the sender 'Michael Learns
        to Rock', partly inspired by a line from his school English textbook and partly because they were a pop band
        taking part in a rock concert. Lentz and Richter have admitted that the band was named after Michael Jackson: "I
        think Richter was thinking of Michael Jackson, because he was called 'the king of pop' and it was kind of funny,
        because it was like, what would he sound like if he learned to rock? It was wordplay," Lentz has stated. Richter
        claimed in an interview : "Yeah, it was like Johnny Hates Jazz and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Sure, I've
        regretted calling ourselves this many times since, but we were successful so quickly, we had to stick with it
        and over time I got used to it."[1]

        On 22 May 1988, the quartet played their first public show in Aarhus in 'Rock Grand Prix' at Aarhus's biggest
        venue, Ridehuset. As one of the two winning teams, MLTR performed that summer at the Aarhus Outdoor Festival on
        20 June, however, only 20 people turned up. The disappointment was offset by a daily newspaper, Information,
        describing the unknown group as "an immensely positive surprise". On 30 July 1988, the group entered and won the
        city's famed annual talent shows 'We Have The Stage – Do You Have The Music?' at Aarhus Musikhus.[5]

        Jens Peter (J.P.) Andersen, a member of the contest jury as well as a promoter of Danmarks Smukkeste Festival
        (literally, "Denmark’s Most Beautiful Festival") at Skanderborg, was impressed with the band's talent but was
        somewhat annoyed at their lack of professionalism, so he decided to become the band's manager, at the band's
        request.[5] Michael Learns to Rock continued playing live throughout Jutland and recording material in order to
        attract the attention of Danish record labels. One of these efforts included the band contributing four tracks
        for the double album Secrets, a record organised by the Danish Rock Council to create interest in four talented
        but 'secret' new bands. They finally signed a record deal with the Danish label Medley in January 1989.[6]
        However, the band did not release their first album, Michael Learns to Rock, until September 1991, backed by the
        American record label Impact Records and with much of the album including the first American single, "My Blue
        Angel", mixed and produced by the American producers Tony Peluso and Steve Barri.[7]

        Although not making any headway as intended in America despite airplay for "My Blue Angel", a later single (the
        second in Denmark after "I Still Carry On") from the album, "The Actor", topped the Danish chart and also did
        well in Norway, Sweden, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.[5] In January 1992, the album topped
        the Danish charts, followed soon after by success in Asia, selling 25,000 copies and earning gold status in
        Indonesia alone.[6]
